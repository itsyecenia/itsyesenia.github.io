    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h4>Heading Font: Bebas Neue</h4>
    <p>I like that the font is bold, wide, and capitalized so that it can put emphasis on it being the title.</p>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Arapey</h4>
    <p>I chose this font because you can see a clear distinction between the heading and the paragraph. The paragraph font is simple.</p>
    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative for your family.</p>
    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
