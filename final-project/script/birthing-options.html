        <p class="optionsp">Your baby's kicks and stretches are a daily reminder that you'll soon get to see your little one's smile. The type of birth experience you want is a very personal decision.</p>

            <h3 >Hospital</h3>
            <p >The vast majority of women in the U.S. give birth in a hospital. If you have a high-risk pregnancy or want to try having a vaginal birth after a cesarean delivery (VBAC), then a hospital is the safest -- and often the only -- place you can deliver your baby. Even if you have a low-risk pregnancy, you may want to give birth in a hospital where you have ready access to the latest in medical technology.</p>

            <h3>Birth Center</h3>
            <p>Some people consider a birthing center delivery the best of both worlds. The setting is relaxing and home-like, and mind-body support options for childbirth pain such as hypnosis, water births, and doulas are readily available.</p>
